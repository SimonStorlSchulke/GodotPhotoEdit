## Ideas
- More Filters 
  - RGB Curves(UI ?))
  - Gausian Blur? Tilt Shift...
    - allows Bloom (Blur with lum Threshold)
- Masks
  - Mask drawing
- Overlay Images (Blendmode, Scale, Rot, Pos, Mask)
  - Blendmodes: Normal, Multiply, Add, Subtract, Divide, Overlay, Screen
- Procedural Textures
- Presets
- Batch Processing
