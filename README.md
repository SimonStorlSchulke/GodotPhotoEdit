# GodotPhotoEdit

Aims to become a simple Photo Editor with a Filter Stack. Written in C# with Godot.

## Todo:
- Open and Save images UI
- use Shaders for filters
- more filters
- Filters need access to pixel position (example: Vignette -> col multiplied by inverse distance to middle) - easier in GLSL thn C# so wait for that.
- Masks
  - Mask drawing
